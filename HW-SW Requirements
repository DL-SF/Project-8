The computational requirements for odometry prediction and storage space required for model are directly 
affected by number of parameters used to define the model. For our network , the parameters are the
weight matrices of the LSTM for both the IMU LSTM and the Core LSTM as well as the CNN network which process
the images. For our network we use LSTMs with 2 layers with cells of 1000 units. Our CNN total of 55M trainable
weights. A forward pass of images through the CNN part of the network takes on average 160ms (â‰ˆ 10Hz) on a single
Tesla k80. The LSTM updates are much less computationally expensive and can run at > 200Hz on the Tesla k80.
