Sensor fusion is the process of combining sensor data or data derived from disparate sources such that the resulting information has 
less uncertainty than would be possible when these sources were used individually.
Our goals are to develop deep learning based sensor fusion techniques that are suited for tracking in Mixed reality systems.
