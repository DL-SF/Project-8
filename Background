Mixed reality systems need to track users in a real-world to keep the illusion of 
“reality”. Multi-modal sensory data acquired from a MR headset (such as Hololens) is used for 
tracking the user in its MR world. Primarily, two kinds of data - inertial and visual - serve as data 
sources for tracking. Sensor fusion techniques stitch these data sources from the 9D inertial data 
and cameras (visual data) to track the user and provide spatial services..
