The pose of a camera relative to an initial starting point is conventionally represented as an element of the special
Euclidean group SE(3) of transformations. SE(3) is a differentiable manifold with elements consisting of a rotation
from the special orthogonal group SO(3) and a translation vector.

Producing transformation estimates belonging to SE(3) is not straightforward as the SO(3) component needs to be
an orthogonal matrix. However, the Lie Algebra se(3) of SE(3), representing the instantaneous transformation,can be described by 
components which are not subject to orthogonality constraints. Conversion between se(3) and SE(3) is then easily accomplished 
using the exponential map 
exp: se(3) â†’ SE(3) 

In our network, a CNN-RNN processes the monocular sequence of images to produce an estimate of the frameto-frame motion
undergone by the camera.

Here the visual ( of dimensions 1280 * 384 *3 ) are fed to the FlowNetC.py file . Here they are flattened
and concatenated with the inertial data being fed into an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). The concatenated
data is then used as input to an SE(3) composition layer where a mathematical operation is carried out 
to convert the data into SE(3) format to estimate the camera pose.
