Extracting and analyzing sensor data from Hololens and researching about sensor fusion algorithm to improve upon existing techniques using feature engineering forms 
our main motivation. Hololens is a powerful tool with built in sensing and compute capabilities - an ideal choiuce for computer vision research 
as well as applications in a various fields such as assisted surgery and remote collaboration, overlaying of digital twins, etc.

Our goal in to develop deep learning based sensor fusion techniques that are suitable for tracking in mixed reality applications 

Main Motivation is it eliminate the need for tedious manual synchronization of the camera and IMU as well as eliminating the need for manual calibration between 
the IMU and camera
