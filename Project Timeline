1st Project checkin : Understanding the peoblem statement and installing the required softwares.
2nd Project checking : Hololens 2 connected from PC and code deployment in Hololens (We have tried to build the Stream Recorder App in Unity 
but have encountered unexpected challenges - it keeps throwing a compilation error- ' unable to write shader into Library')
3rd Project Check in : We will discuss the motivation, system requirements, implementation and design alternatives to our project. PV and Depth Throw data data extracted from the Holololens 
and work began on implementing VINet. We downloaded the Sophus file form the internet and tried to install it but setup file is not being able to build 
because of the pybind11 module. The pybind11 module is not able to build from Google Colab.

We were able to extract the complete data from the Hololens 2 device( image data and the IMU data ) at last! after making the necesssary adjustments
to the SensorScnario.cpp and AppMain.cpp and other such files , the StreamRecorder sln file was deployed to the HoloLens 2 and data ( depth_long_throw, extrinsics,
Photovideo data , accelerometer, gyromter and magnetometer data ) were all successfully collected . The screenshots of the same have been provided
in the report.
