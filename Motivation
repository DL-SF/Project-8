Extracting and analyzing sensor data from Hololens and researching about sensor fusion algorithm to improve upon existing techniques using feature engineering forms 
our main motivation. Hololens is a powerful tool with built in sensing and compute capabilities - an ideal choiuce for computer vision research 
as well as applications in a various fiels such as assisted surgery and remote collaboration, overlaying of digital twins, etc.
which i have some idea in data analysis.
Mainly to know more about this topic like  how sensor fusion stitches both (inertial & visual) data
